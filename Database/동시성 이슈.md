## 동시성 이슈를 @Transactional 만으로 해결하지 못하는 이유
- @Transactional 사용하여 Race condition 이슈를 방지할 수는 있지만
  - Using the @Transactional annotation alone may not always be sufficient to resolve all synchronization issues, as it mainly provides a way to define a transaction boundary for database operations and does not address low-level synchronization issues between threads. Locking mechanisms, such as the synchronized keyword or explicit locks, may still be necessary in some cases to ensure mutually exclusive access to shared resources and prevent race conditions. 
  -  it's worth noting that in certain cases, you might still need to manually manage locks in conjunction with the @Transactional annotation to prevent race conditions or other concurrency-related issues.

## 동시성 이슈 종류(예시)
1. Race condition : Multiple threads trying to increment the same counter without proper synchronization.
2. Deadlock : Two threads holding a lock on different resources, waiting for each other to release their respective locks.
3. Livelock : Two threads trying to cross a bridge, but both keep yielding to each other to let the other cross first.
4. Starvation : A low-priority thread waiting for a resource that is constantly being acquired by high-priority threads.
5. Data race : Two threads accessing a shared collection without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable results when adding or removing elements from the collection.

## 해결 방법
- Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a shared resource. You can avoid deadlocks by following a strict order when acquiring locks, or by using lock timeout mechanisms.
- Starvation: Starvation occurs when a thread is unable to access a shared resource due to the presence of other high-priority threads. You can avoid starvation by implementing fairness policies when acquiring locks, or by using java.util.concurrent.Semaphore.
- Livelocks: Livelocks occur when two or more threads keep changing their state in response to each other, but none of them makes progress. You can avoid livelocks by using a timeout mechanism when acquiring locks, or by using java.util.concurrent.Exchanger.

## lock 적용 방식
- Synchronized Methods: You can use the synchronized keyword in front of a method to make it thread-safe. When a thread calls a synchronized method, it acquires a lock on the object, and the other threads will have to wait until the lock is released.
- Synchronized Blocks: You can also use synchronized blocks to lock a specific section of code. The block is wrapped in a synchronized statement and the object used as the lock is specified in the parentheses.
- Reentrant Locks: Reentrant locks are a more flexible alternative to synchronized methods and blocks. They provide more fine-grained control over locking, and can be used in more complex synchronization scenarios.
- The best approach to using locks depends on the specific requirements of your code and the desired level of concurrency. It's important to choose the appropriate locking mechanism and apply it correctly to avoid deadlocks, livelocks, and other synchronization issues.
