## 단일 스레드 프로그래밍의 대표적인 예
- Single-threaded programming is commonly used for simple, small-scale applications such as simple desktop programs, scripts, and utilities. Examples include calculator, text editor, to-do list app, media player, etc. These programs don't require complex coordination of multiple tasks, and a single thread can handle the user interface, data processing, and storage efficiently

- multithreading can be used to improve the overall performance of an application by allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as downloading multiple files simultaneously.
For example, instead of downloading each file one at a time and waiting for each download to complete before starting the next, you can use multiple threads to download multiple files at the same time. This can significantly reduce the overall time required to complete all the downloads.
In Java, you can use the java.util.concurrent package to create and manage threads, or you can use executors, thread pools, and other concurrency utilities to manage a group of threads. You can also use the @Async annotation in Spring framework to make a method run in a separate thread asynchronously.

    <summary>@Async가 멀티스레드를 대체할 수 있을까?</summary>

-  The "@Async" annotation in Java can be used to run methods asynchronously in a separate thread, but it won't necessarily replace multi-threading entirely.
The "@Async" annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed asynchronously in a different thread, often managed by a task executor. This can be useful for running time-consuming or blocking operations, such as database queries or I/O operations, in the background, so that the main thread isn't blocked and can continue to process other tasks.
However, simply annotating a method with "@Async" does not guarantee that it will run in a separate thread. It still depends on the implementation and configuration of the task executor that manages the asynchronous method execution.
In summary, the "@Async" annotation provides a convenient way to run methods asynchronously, but it may not be suitable for all multi-threading scenarios and should be used with caution.
